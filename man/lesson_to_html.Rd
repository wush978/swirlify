\description{
Create an easily shareable HTML version of your swirl lesson. This function
detects the lesson you are working on
automatically via \code{getOption('swirlify_lesson_file_path')},
converts it to R Markdown (Rmd), then generates a stylized HTML
document and opens it in your default browser. To prevent clutter,
the Rmd files are not kept by default, but they can be kept
by setting \code{keep_rmd = TRUE}.
}
\details{
The output is formatted to be a readable, standalone tutorial.
This means that information contained in the swirl lesson such as
answer tests and hints are excluded from the Rmd/HTML output.
