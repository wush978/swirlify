\description{
Creates a new lesson and possibly a new course in your working directory. If
the name you provide for \code{course_name} is not a directory in your
working directory, then a new course directory will be created. However if
you've already started a course with the name you provide for \code{course_name}
and that course is in your working directory, then a new lesson will be created
inside of that course with the name you provide for \code{lesson_name}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Make sure you have your working directory set to where you want to
# create the course.
setwd(file.path("~", "Developer", "swirl_courses"))

# Make a new course with a new lesson
new_lesson("How to use pnorm", "Normal Distribution Functions in R")

# Make a new lesson in an existing course
new_lesson("How to use qnorm", "Normal Distribution Functions in R")
}
